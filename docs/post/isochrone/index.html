      <p>The Gaia mission has transformed our understanding of open clusters by significantly reducing scatter in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). This improvement allows for more precise stellar modelling, making M67 an ideal test case.</p>
<p>Using Gaia‚Äôs refined CMD, we developed new stellar models that avoid common simplifications in 1D modelling, such as <strong>mass-independent core overshooting</strong> and a <strong>constant mixing length parameter</strong>. This approach led to an isochrone tailored specifically for M67, now available for download.</p>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">Isochrone A and M67 presumed single stars in absolute magnitude and colour-coded by (a) Œ±<sub>MLT</sub>

‚Å†, and (d) stellar mass. The dashed line in (b) crosses the isochrone where the Œ±<sub>MLT</sub> 3D grid stops at 2.4. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We adjusted input physics to match the observed CMD sequence and tested the model-predicted masses against an <strong>eclipsing binary</strong> at the cluster‚Äôs main sequence turnoff. Despite improvements in photometry and stellar physics, a single isochrone could not reproduce the masses of both binary components simultaneously, highlighting persistent modelling challenges.</p>
<p>A <strong>œá¬≤-based isochrone fit</strong> using our preferred physics yields a cluster age of <strong>3.95 ¬± 0.16 Gyr</strong>. While Gaia‚Äôs precision has enhanced isochrone fitting, reconciling observed and theoretical stellar properties remains complex. Further refinements, potentially incorporating asteroseismic or spectroscopic constraints, could offer deeper insights.</p>
