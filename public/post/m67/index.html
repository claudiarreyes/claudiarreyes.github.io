      <p>Ensemble asteroseismology has revolutionized our ability to empirically link observed seismic properties to fundamental stellar parameters. Star clusters, with their uniform metallicity, distance, and age, provide an ideal environment for refining these relations.</p>
<p>In this study, we present the first asteroseismic analysis of M67 that spans its full evolutionary sequence, from subgiants to core helium-burning red giants, including a yellow straggler.</p>

  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">Examples of the characteristic "near Gaussian"-shaped excess power observed in the power spectra of M67 stars from near the tip of the red-giant
branch (EPIC 211376143) to the subgiant branch (EPIC 211414203). The yellow curves represent the smoothed power spectrum, the white area represents the
portion of the spectrum where the excess power is located, and the red vertical lines indicate the frequency of maximum power, ùúà<sub>max</sub>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Using <strong>Kepler/K2</strong> data, we measure seismic surface gravity, examine the potential role of core magnetic fields, and derive an empirical expression for the <strong>seismic surface term</strong>. We also extend the analysis of the asymptotic phase term <strong>…õ</strong> to evolutionary stages previously unexplored in detail.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/images/phaseterm_multipanel_errbars.png" alt="Phase term">
  <figcaption style="font-size: 0.8em; color: gray;">In all panels the black solid curve shows phase-term and Œîùúà from models along the isochrone, and the dashed line shows the same, but after applying
the correction given by the power-law fit derived in this work.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A key focus of our work is the calibration of <strong>seismic scaling relations</strong> for mass and radius. We quantify the systematic errors introduced when surface term corrections are omitted from state-of-the-art stellar models, demonstrating how significantly the scaling relations are affected by missing corrections. Our mass estimates indicate that the <strong>Reimers mass loss parameter cannot exceed Œ∑ ‚âà 0.23</strong> at the 2œÉ level.</p>
<p>Using isochrone models tailored to M67, we compare individual mode frequencies with theoretical predictions. While seismic masses for subgiants and red giant branch stars align well with isochrone expectations, we find an inconsistency with one component of an <strong>eclipsing binary near the TAMS</strong>. A traditional <strong>œá¬≤-based seismic fit</strong> provides an estimated cluster age of <strong>3.95 ¬± 0.35 Gyr</strong>.</p>
