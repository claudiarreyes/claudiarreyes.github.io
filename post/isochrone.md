The Gaia mission has transformed our understanding of open clusters by significantly reducing scatter in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). This improvement allows for more precise stellar modelling, making M67 an ideal test case.  

Using Gaia‚Äôs refined CMD, we developed new stellar models that avoid common simplifications in 1D modelling, such as **mass-independent core overshooting** and a **constant mixing length parameter**. This approach led to an isochrone tailored specifically for M67, now available for download.

We adjusted input physics to match the observed CMD sequence and tested the model-predicted masses against an **eclipsing binary** at the cluster‚Äôs main sequence turnoff. Despite improvements in photometry and stellar physics, a single isochrone could not reproduce the masses of both binary components simultaneously, highlighting persistent modelling challenges.  

A **œá¬≤-based isochrone fit** using our preferred physics yields a cluster age of **3.95 ¬± 0.16 Gyr**. While Gaia‚Äôs precision has enhanced isochrone fitting, reconciling observed and theoretical stellar properties remains complex. Further refinements, potentially incorporating asteroseismic or spectroscopic constraints, could offer deeper insights.
